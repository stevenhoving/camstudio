What's new in ver 2.0
=====================

1) Flash (.swf) Output -- you can now produce small, stream-able Flash files with lossless compression (in perfect quality) with CamStudio.
   
This is made possible with the introduction of a new module -- the SWF Producer -- that is distributed with the CamStudio package.	
   
What the SWF Producer basically does is to convert AVI files to Flash (.swf) files. It can convert almost all AVI files to Flash, including those not produced with CamStudio. 
   
   
The SWF Producer can operate in 3 modes
   
A) Standalone mode
The SWF Producer runs like a normal program. You launch it by selecting the Tools :: SWF Producer command inside the CamStudio Screen Recorder. 
Or you can simply double click the Producer.exe file in the installed directory.
   
   
   
B) Record Directly to Flash
You can set the CamStudio Recorder to record directly to Flash.
   
   
   
C) Commandline mode (silence mode)
The Producer can also be launched on the command line (in DOS Prompt) by typing 

Producer -b filename.avi

When Producer is launched this way, it opens the file "filename.avi" when it starts, automatically converts the AVI movie to Flash, and then exits.  
It will not issue any error messages during conversion. You can convert multiple AVI files this way.
   


2) With the Autonaming feature -- you can now avoid giving a name to every AVI you record. 
(Options : Program Options : Name of AVI file)

The name of the file is automatically formed using the system's date and time of recording and is saved in CamStudio's installed directory. 

   
   
3) Improvements to CamStudio Player 2.0 (playplus.exe). 

The following options are now available when running playplus.exe in the command line mode.


playplus  -a filename.avi   
 
This will launch the AVI file (filename.avi) and play it automatically.
  
   


playplus  -x filename.avi 
   
This will launch the AVI file (filename.avi) and play it automatically. The player will exit when the playback is completed.



What's new in ver 1.8
=====================

1)Screen Annotation -- allows you to display screen captions on your desktop while recording. These captions are anti-aliased, high quality images that can display text in multiple languages. You can also make a caption transparent and create a cutout region for it. 

2)Video Annotation  -- allows you to stream the contents of your webcam onto your desktop. With this feature, you can add a personal touch to your recordings by including a movie of yourself into the AVI. The video annotations window, like the screen annotations, can be made transparent (Win XP) and assigned a cutout region.
 
3)You can now pan the fixed region of recording by dragging any of the four corners around it.
 
4)With the new Audio and Video Synchronization feature, you can now shift the video stream slightly to make the audio and video streams to be in phase. 
 
5)Bugs are fixed for keyboard shortcuts that may not function properly in previous versions.


Bugs fixed and improvements in ver 1.60
=======================================

1)Recording of sound from your speakers (for soundcards that support this feature)

2)Capturing of translucent/layered windows (for Win 2000/XP)

3)Update of the controls to Win XP look (for Win XP users only)

3)Ability to customize the temporary directory for recording. Setting this to an appropriate drive can reduce crashes due to lack of free space.

4)Some bug fixes (filtering out certain codecs that crash CamStudio)



Bugs fixed and improvements in ver 1.25
=======================================

1)Support for the DivX Codec (for certain image dimensions).

2)Recording with audio in default settings will no longer give a huge filesize.

3)You may now specify the interleave factor of audio of video in milliseconds instead of frames.

4)You may now indicate the X and Y values of a fixed region *before* the recording starts. 
 



What's new in ver 1.2
=====================

1)Saving of user settings on exit. 

2)Support for user-customizable shortcuts to start/stop the recorder. 

3)An improved video options panel.
