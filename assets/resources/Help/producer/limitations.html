<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>The SWF Producer is most effective for converting files that are created as tutorials. These AVIs are usually characterized by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Having a limited number of colors (i.e. do not have many gradient-filled regions)</li>
	<li>Not changing much in between each frame, except for the mouse movements</li>
	<li>Being saved in perfect quality (e.g. with the Microsoft Video 1 codec at quality set to 100)</li>
</ol>
<p>For AVI files that do not hold the above attributes, the compression algorithm in the SWF Producer will not work well and may even cause the SWF file to be much larger than the AVI file.</p>
