<h1>Notes</h1>
<h2>Quality &amp; Performance</h2>
<p>CamStudio creates a movie by sampling the screen on fixed-time intervals. If this sampling frequency is too slow, it may not be able to pick up some cursor movements if the mouse moves too fast. The result of this will be that the cursor will appear to jump, become jerky or even cannot be seen in the recorded movie. It is thus advisable to slow down your mouse movements during recording.</p><p>This sampling problem can also happen when you are recording a fast animation. If CamStudio cannot record much faster than the changes in the animation, CamStudio will miss out on some important data and the playback will not be smooth.</p>
<h2>Frame Rates</h2>
<p>The speed of your computer will directly affect the performance of CamStudio. A slow CPU will unquestionably mean slower frame rates. For the best performance, use the fastest computer available for recording.</p><p>Apart from CPU speed, the following factors will also affect the performance of the recording:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Recording a movie that covers a large area.</li>
		<li>Recording pictures that contain many colors in.</li>
		<li>Running other applications during recording sessions.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>File Size</h3>
<p>An AVI file usually has a very large file size, especially for those lengthy and detailed videos. This is due to the fact that a video file has to pack hundreds and thousands of images into a single file. It is thus very common to have size exceeding one megabyte.</p><p>To reduce the size of the AVI file, you can do the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Limiting the area of the region being captured.</li>
		<li>Limiting the (input) rate of which video frames are captured. This can be set in the Capture Frames Every field of Video Options.</li>
		<li>Changing the compressor and compression quality.  By changing the compression quality, you are essentially making a tradeoff between picture quality and the file size.</li>
	</ul>
