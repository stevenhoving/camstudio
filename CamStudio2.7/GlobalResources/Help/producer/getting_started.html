<title>Getting Started with SWF Producer</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p><img src="images/main_window.png" alt="SWF Producer main window" class="inline_image_r" /></p>
<p>CamStudio SWF Producer converts AVI movies to Flash (.swf) files. Normally, an AVI converted to SWF by the producer results in a much smaller file that can be streamed across the internet.</p>
<p>The SWF Producer is able to convert AVIs to Flash files in a lossless manner. This means there is no degradation of image quality or decrease in frame rates. For an AVI with small dimensions running at high frame rates, the .swf filesize is about 30% of the original AVI file. For large image-sized AVIs, the reduction in file size is even more dramatic, with the converted file being only 5% of the original AVI.</p>
<p>You can even further enhance the .swf produced by CamStudio by loading it in a container in Flash MX editor. For more details, please refer to the section on <a href="further_editing.html">Further Editing</a> of the Flash (.swf) movie.</p>
