=======================================
	
- Recorder:
	4/26/2010
	o	clean up files: remove extraneous whitespace
	o	ScreenAnnotationDlg ctor now initializes cursor handles to null and loads them
		in OnInitDialog.	
	
	2/20/09
**	o	Recorder shortcuts completely block the keys from being heard by another application
		This is a big problem since the default F7-F10 are extremely useful when debugging with
		VS. Also, it doesn't let you save multiple shortcuts as NONE. Also the GUI for shortcuts
		is pretty terrible, look at the shortcuts menu in VS for a better concept.
	o	audio/video sync problems when recording long videos -- theories on how to fix this?
	o	On some systems CamStudio doesn't correctly detect all installed codecs -- replicate?
	
	1/1/09
**	o	Options-Record audio from speakers causes WaveoutgetSelectedContron (Vista) **
	o	Under audio options dialog device names are truncated. (Vista)
	
	10/19/08
	o	Video Options - Compressor: Codec 1.5 - Configure GZZP partially visible.
	o	All settings not saved restored; Selected compressor reverts to MS Video 1
		(or first compressor list item?)
	o	Audio is choppy with no interleave on all compressors other than MCI.
		-	Microsoft's MP3 codec
		-	The latest LAME ACM 3.98
		-	Microsoft's ADPCM codec
		-	PCM (no compression)	
	o	Keyboard shortcuts are saved but not restored.
	o	Recorder didn't switch to German language when configured.
	
	10/25/08
	o The CSyncDlg if causing a non-fatal exception during initalization in wincore. 
	
	
- Installation:
	1/20/09
	o	The codec doesn't install properly during the studio installation. The user has to
		manually install with right-click on the INF.
		
Resolved Issues:
	o	(fixed 2/22/09 - Jason) Record window capture mode seems to be broken.
	o	(fixed 2/20/09 - Jason) menu "Help" on second row.
	o	(fixed 2/18/09 - Jason) From Windows Explorer:
		Right Button + "Open With..." + select Player Classic or PlayerPlus will not
		play video; must use the player File-Open.
	o	(fixed ? - ?) the global ScreenAnnotationDlg (sad) ctor attempts to access the
		instance handle from the AFX lib too early. The handle is now taken from
		the system and then the varibles are reinitialized during the InitDialog
		member function
	o	(fixed ? - ?) Vista blocks install to "Program Files" and "system32" folders
