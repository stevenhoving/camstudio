<p>RenderSoft CamStudio is a tool for recording screen activity into standard AVI video files. If you move the cursor, launch a new program, type some text, click a few buttons, or select some menus - anything that you see on your screen - CamStudio will be able to record all these and allow you to play them back later on.</p>
<p>You can use CamStudio to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create demonstrations of programs by recording the movement of the cursor, the selection of menus, the entering of text or the display of messages. These demonstrations, when shown to users, can illustrate features and usage of the program in a short period time with maximum clarity. The recorded movies can be added to the accompanying help files of commercial software to make them more professional. The recorded videos, if converted to a stream-able format, can also be posted to your websites to enliven them. With broadband becoming more affordable, multimedia websites are the preferred and more effective means of communication.</li>
<li>Create movies used in user trainings.</li>
<li>Track the progress of a program that executes for a long time.</li>
<li>Record the sequence of steps that cause the occurrence of bugs in faulty software.</li>
<li>Record a movie stream.</li>
<li>Convert AVI files to Flash (SWF) files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving images impact our lives heavily nowadays. A changing image speaks much more than a stationary snapshot. Anyone who has watched a movie understands how the power of animation can immensely enhance the process of communication. By capturing the moving action faithfully on your computer screen, CamStudio is essentially putting this power right onto your computer desktop.</p>
<p>The video files created by RenderSoft CamStudio are saved in the standard AVI (Audio Video Interleave) format, which is used pervasively in many Windows applications that support video, including Microsoft Office. You can effectively paste an AVI file into an Office application just like pasting text.</p>
<p>This ensures maximum compatibility with other software, and you can easily edit the output of CamStudio with a third party video editor.</p>
