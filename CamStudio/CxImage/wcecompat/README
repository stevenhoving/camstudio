This is a work in progress.  You will no doubt find that the code here is a
real mess at the moment, but it does work.  A cleaner version will be available
shortly, keep an eye on the website.


Building
--------

To build, set the environment variables with one of the batch files installed
with eVC, and then invoke nmake.

Two libraries are built:

* wcecompat.lib
* wcecompatex.lib

In this initial release, both libraries are identical and contain the
functionality that is meant for wcecompatex.lib.  This library contains
features to support stdin/stdout/stderr and their redirection.  The first
library will in the future be a leaner library without these features.
Whilst both libraries will be suitable for releasable applications it is
assumed that some people will not want these extra features outside of
debugging, and therefore the cutdown version will be provided.


Todo
----

Build a version that doesn't contain the stdin/stdout/stderr support.

Finish and cleanup implementation of existing functions, particularly
the stream IO.
