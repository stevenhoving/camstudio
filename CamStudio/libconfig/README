If you do not wish to build the C++ components, use:

./configure --disable-cxx

The `examples' subdirectory contains some examples of using libconfig
from C and C++.

The config file syntax changed between versions 0.8 and 0.9. In order
to implement all of the feature/enhancement requests in an elegant and
self-consistent way, the configuration grammar had to be changed in a
non-backward-compatible way. In particular, groups are now values, so
the old syntax:

group
{
  ...
}

must now be written as:

group =
{
  ...
};

Note that the trailing semicolon, which was previously optional, is
now required. Also note that a colon (':') can be used in place of the
equals sign.

Flex and Bison are not required in order to build this
package. However, if you modify the .l or .y files, you must have Flex
(2.5.31 or better) and Bison (2.1 or better), respectively.

To successfully compile using MinGW (with gcc 4.4.0 or later), it may
be necessary to modify the file "mingw32\4.4.0\libstdc++.la", changing line 11
from:

library_names='libstdc++.dll.a'

to:

library_names='libstdc++.a'
