For the sake of being historically complete, I am including the original license text that accompanied CamStudio 2.0. 

However the licensing conditions below seem to be incompatible with V2 of the GNU Public License which CamStudio 2.0 was originally released under.

In my opinion the GPL will almost certainly take precidence over the conditions below, so unless you have heard otherwise, you must abide by the conditions set out in the GNU Public License V2 (see accompanying gpl.txt textfile for full details or go to http://www.gnu.org/gpl)

If you are in any doubt, please contact your lawyer or get legal advice before releasing a commercial product based on CamStudio. Do not take my opinion as legal advice, I am not a lawyer nor do I play one on TV.
