This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.6):

  Revised pngtest so memory allocation testing is only done when PNG_DEBUG==1.
  Removed unused pngasmrd.h file.
  Removed references to uu.net for archived files.  Added references to
    PNG Spec (second edition) and the PNG ISO/IEC Standard.
  Added "test-dd" target in 15 makefiles, to run pngtest in DESTDIR.
  Fixed bug with "optimized window size" in the IDAT datastream, that
    causes libpng to write PNG files with incorrect zlib header bytes.
  Fixed bug with sCAL chunk and big-endian machines (David Munro).
  Undid new code added in 1.2.6 to update the color_type in
    png_set_filler().
  Added png_set_add_alpha() that updates color type.
  Revised png_set_strip_filler() to not remove alpha if color_type has alpha.
  Added makefile.hp64
  Changed projects/msvc/png32ms.def to scripts/png32ms.def in makefile.cygwin
