  There is no \"configure\" script in this distribution of
  libpng-1.2.7.

  Instead, please copy the appropriate makefile for your system from the
  \"scripts\" directory.  Read the INSTALL file for more details.

  Update, July 2004: you can get a "configure" based distribution
  from the libpng distribution sites.  Download the file
