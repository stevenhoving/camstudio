First step:

Install ToirtoiseHG on your system.

Logon in Camstudio Sourceforge.

Open file explorer and go to your development environment.
Keep top of your development stack.

Open HG repository browser:

Right click with mouse + ToirtoiseHG + Clone

Set the Source URL location to:
http://camstudio.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/camstudio/camstudio

<ENTER>

Decide what you want to download regular (HEAD) or defined by an named revision.

BTW.
If you are a developer and want to be able to upload your worjk to Camstudio 
you should not use the above http reference.
You need to use a ssh URL to be able to write to the repository:

ssh://janhgm@camstudio.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/camstudio/camstudio  

(Replace janhgm with your own sourceforge userename)
