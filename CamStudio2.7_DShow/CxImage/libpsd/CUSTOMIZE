How to customize the compilation of the Libpsd
==============================================

1. 3rd libraries
 Libpsd depends on the other libraries, you have to download them before you compile 
 Libpsd.
 
 Libjpeg: We need libjpeg to get the thumbnail, you can download libjpeg from 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg.
 
 Zlib: Photoshop CS and CS2 use the zip arithmetic for data uncompression, you can 
 download zlib from http://www.zlib.net.
 
 Libxml: We need libxml to get the XMP metadata, you can download libxml from 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/libxml.
 
 Libexif: We need libexif to get the exif info, you can download EXIF Tag Parsing 
 Library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif.
 
 
2. Configuration macros

 The file found in `include/psd_config.h' contains a list of commented configuration 
 macros that can be toggled by developers to indicate which features should be active 
 while building the library.
 
 We invite you to read this file for more information. You can
 change the file's content to suit your needs, or override it with
 one of the techniques described below.
 
 PSD_INCLUDE_LIBJPEG : Photoshop uses jpeg format to save the thumbnail. So, if you
 don't want to read the thumbnail as a quick preview, you can undef this macro. 
 Otherwise, you have to link libjpeg in your project.
 
 PSD_INCLUDE_ZLIB : This is necessary and important library. From the version of 
 Photoshop CS, it uses the zip arithmetic for data compression, to reduce the file
 size. So, if you want to read the format of Photoshop CS or CS2, the zip 
 uncompression should be included.
 
 PSD_GET_ALL_IMAGE_RESOURCE : The most of the information is in the data block of 
 image resource, such as resolution, names of alpha channles, thumbnail, global 
 altitude, border, path. But not all the resource must be readed, most of them are
 not useful for your project. Read the file image_resource.c, to undef this macro
 will hide some information and reduce the time of parsing.
 
 PSD_INCLUDE_LIBXML : XMP¡ªthe Extensible Metadata Platform¡ªis designed to provide
 XMP metadata, it standardizes the definition, creation, and processing, and it's 
 the XML format. We use the libxml to parse the XMP. Most of the projects don't need
 this, to undef this macro and reduce the parsing time.
 
 PSD_INCLUDDE_LIBEXIF : Exif is Exchangeable image file format for digital still 
 cameras. We use the libexif to parse this data.
 
 PSD_GET_PATH_RESOURCE : Photoshop saves the path into the image resource block, 
 from ID 2000 to 2999. Path is the vector information to describe points. This 
 macro depends on your project.
 
 PSD_SUPPORT_LAYER_BLEND : We provide file blend.c to blend the psd file after 
 modified. The psd file only saves the merged layer in the image data block, and
 it's not transparent. To get the transprent merged data, you should blend it again.
 You can change most of the parameters like layer opacity, and use the blend.c to
 blend it.
 
 PSD_SUPPORT_EFFECTS_BLEND : Layer effect is the special part that psd file doesn't
 provide, there is only un-effected layer data. Layer effects include shadow, glow, 
 emboss, overlay, stroke and satin. Layer blending will apply these effects.
 
 PSD_SUPPORT_CMYK, PSD_SUPPORT_LAB, PSD_SUPPORT_MULTICHANNEL : 
 These are the color spaces named CMYK, LAB and multi-channel, like RGB and grayscale. 
 Libpsd uses the formula to convert these color to RGB color, so, there is little 
 different with Photoshop provides, the latter uses many tables to apply these.
 
3. Run on your platform

 The psd_system.c file is the important file for your platform. The original file is 
 written for standard C, the memory management and file system are the standard C 
 usage. Maybe you should change this file to adapt for current system. Otherwise, 
 you will compile it failed, or make the system errors.
 
 There are only two types of system interface, memory management and file system. 
 
 Maybe you should check the psd_types.h, there are the basic types that Libpsd often
 uses.
